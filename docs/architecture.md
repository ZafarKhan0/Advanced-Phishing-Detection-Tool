# System Architecture

## Overview
The Advanced Phishing Detection Tool is designed to detect phishing attempts in emails and websites. It consists of several components:

1. Data Collection and Preprocessing: This module collects and preprocesses data from phishing and legitimate sources.
2. Feature Extraction and Model Training: Extracts features from text data and trains a machine learning model.
3. Application: A standalone Python application that uses the trained model to predict phishing attempts.

## Data Flow
- Data Collection: Data is collected and labeled from various sources.
- Preprocessing: Data is cleaned, and features are extracted.
- Model Training: A machine learning model is trained on the processed data.
- Prediction: The trained model is used to predict phishing attempts in real-time.

## Technologies
- Python: Core programming language used for data processing, model training, and application development.
- Scikit-learn: Used for machine learning algorithms.
- Pandas: Used for data manipulation and analysis.
- Pickle: Used for model serialization.
